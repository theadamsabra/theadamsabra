### Hi! My name is Adam Sabra and I am a Machine Learning Engineer.

My goal is to use the skills and tools in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to pave my own path in music and ML research. My research focuses are music information retrieval and graph neural networks. When I am not working, I'm probably collecting new vinyls.
