### Hi! My name is Adam Sabra and I am an undergraduate from the University of California, Davis.
### I majored in Statistics with a track focus in Machine Learning.

My goal is to use the skills and tools in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to pave my own path in music and ML research. When I am not working as an ML Engineer, I am playing either playing chess or collecting vinyls and cassettes to listen to!
