### Hi! My name is Adam Sabra and I am an undergraduate senior at the University of California, Davis.
### My major is in Statistics with a track focus in Machine Learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [my thesis to solve Blind Source Separation](https://github.com/theadamsabra/Audio-Source-Separation-Undergraduate-Thesis)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [about Convolutional Neural Networks from Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) for free.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently searching for a full time position after graduation.

My goal is to use the skills and tools in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to pave my own path in audio research.
